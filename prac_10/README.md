# Reflection

### Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?
In the beginning, my estimates were often inaccurate as I underestimated the time required for certain tasks. However, as the subject progressed, my accuracy improved. I learned the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller components and considering potential obstacles. Doing estimates helped me understand the complexity of tasks and improved my time management skills.

### Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
Being reviewed and giving reviews taught me the value of transparent communication and helpful feedback. Being evaluated helped me uncover areas for improvement in my code, while doing reviews helped me understand varied coding styles and methods. It also taught me to seek for possible flaws or improvements in other people's programs.

### Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
If I were in charge of the subject, I would include more collaborative projects and real-world examples. Furthermore, I would offer additional help on software development and urge students to improve their problem-solving abilities.

# Code Reviews

### [Wilson Vallerian](https://github.com/Wilson-Vallerian/cp1404practicals/pull/6)
I highlighted the good usage of classes. The code demonstrated clear object-oriented design principles, with well-defined classes and methods. The code structure was logical, making it easy to understand the relationships between different components.

### [Ralph Budiono](https://github.com/Raltyez/cp1404practicals/pull/5)
When reviewing the square number GUI, I focused on its user-friendly interface. I loved the addition of docstrings to the miles to km calculation GUI, and I praised the introduction of real-time feedback in the dynamic labels GUI.
